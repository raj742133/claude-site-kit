## Hairline

Sitewright's line figures (`skill/sitewright/templates/fx/figures/`) include the engine and nineteen figures of
[Hairline](https://github.com/lucasmarkes/hairline), copied with small changes (the figures are split into one module each, and
`intensity.ts` has three more entries). Three more figures (`bars`, `scanner`, `parcel`) are written for Sitewright on the same engine.

Hairline is released under the MIT licence:

## Better Icons and Iconify

Sitewright's icon support (`skill/sitewright/scripts/lib/icons.mjs`) follows the approach of
[Better Icons](https://github.com/better-auth/better-icons) by Better Auth Inc. (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 Better Auth Inc.): icons
are looked up by `prefix:name` in the [Iconify](https://iconify.design) data (the API at `api.iconify.design`, and the
`@iconify-json/<set>` packages), aliases are followed to the real icon, and the answer is turned into an inline SVG. The code is
written for Sitewright rather than copied; the idea, the id format and the way aliases are resolved are theirs. Better Icons is also what the skill
suggests an agent use to search for icons.

## Lucide

The icons the kit ships so a site has icons with no network (`skill/sitewright/templates/icons/lucide.json`, about 200 of them) are from
[Lucide](https://lucide.dev), ISC licensed, with some derived from Feather (MIT, Copyright (c) 2013-present Cole Bemis). The full licence text is
inside the pack and is written to `src/components/icons/NOTICE.md` of every generated project that uses one of its icons. Icons from other sets
keep their own licences, which the same file records.
