 * Postgres.
 *
 * Two backings behind one tiny interface, for the same reason the storage layer has three: an
 * abstraction with a single implementation is a guess, and this one had to be real before the
 * Android uploader could be tested at all.
 *
 *  - **`postgres://…`** goes to a real server through `pg` - Neon, Vercel Postgres, Supabase, or
 *    anything else. This is what production uses.
 *  - **`pglite://<dir>`, or no DATABASE_URL at all**, runs Postgres compiled to WebAssembly, in
 *    process, against a directory. No server to install, and it is genuinely Postgres rather than
 *    a SQLite lookalike - the same SQL, the same `FILTER (WHERE …)` aggregates, the same JSONB.
 *    That matters: a dev database that accepts different SQL to production is a trap.
 *
 * `pg` rather than an ORM. The whole model is a handful of tables and the interesting queries are
 * aggregations shown verbatim on the page; an ORM would add a build step and a migration framework
 * to save about forty lines of SQL.
