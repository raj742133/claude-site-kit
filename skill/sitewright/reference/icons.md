# Icons

Sites made with Sitewright have icons where they help: in the navigation, on stat cards, on status chips and badges, in the features list and in the story steps. The drawings come from the open icon sets behind [Iconify](https://iconify.design) (200,000+ icons in 150+ sets), found with the help of **[better-icons](https://github.com/better-auth/better-icons)** (MIT, Better Auth Inc.), a search tool for agents and the command line over the same data.

A generated site carries **only the icons it uses**, as plain inline SVG in the colour of the text around it. No icon font, no icon library, no request at run time. Nothing is added unless chosen: a place with no icon looks exactly as it did.

## Using them

```jsonc
"icons": "auto"                       // fill the places a title clearly names, leave the rest alone
// or
"icons": { "auto": true, "set": "lucide", "custom": { "bean": "<svg viewBox='0 0 24 24'>...</svg>" }, "extra": ["mdi:home"] }
```

Name an icon anywhere a place takes one, as `"prefix:name"` (`lucide:coffee`, `tabler:home`, `mdi:account`) or just `"coffee"` for the site's default set (`set`, default `lucide`). `custom:bean` is one of your own.

| Place | Where it goes in the config | Where it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nav.<id>` | `nav.icons: { "dashboard": "layout-dashboard", "connect": ..., "publishing" or "team": ..., "home": ... }` | the header links (`dashboard`, `connect`, `publishing`, `team`, `home`) |
| `stats.<n>` | `dashboard.stats[n].icon` | a corner of the stat card, in its tone colour |
| `statuses.<id>` | `dashboard.statuses[].icon` | the filter chip and the badge on every record card |
| `features.ready.<n>` | the optional third item of a ready feature: `["Roast to order", "Every bag is roasted after you order it.", "coffee"]` | in place of the dot |
| `features.next.<n>` | the optional fourth item of an upcoming feature: `[name, text, beingBuilt, "gift"]` | in place of the dot |
| `story.<n>` | `landing.story.steps[n].icon` | beside the step's time label |

`extra` lists icons to include without a place, for code you add yourself (`import { Icon } from '@/components/icons/Icon'`, then `<Icon name="mdi:home" />`).

### `auto`

Reads each title for whole words and only fills what it is sure of: nav links, the three default statuses, and titles with a clear keyword (orders, delivery, payment, revenue, customers, attention, done, sync, scan, schedule, a dozen trades such as coffee, law, fitness, clinic). A title that names nothing gets no icon, and one list never shows the same icon twice. Review what it chose in `site.json`; it writes the full ids there.

## Finding the right icon

- With the **better-icons** tools available in the session (the `search_icons`, `get_icon`, `recommend_icons` MCP tools, or `npx better-icons search <word> --prefix lucide`), use them: that is what they are for. Set it up once with `npx better-icons setup`.
- Without them: `node scripts/scaffold.mjs --list-icons coffee` lists matching names in the kit's pack and any installed set, and searches Iconify too when the network allows (`--offline-icons` skips that; `--icon-prefix tabler` picks a set).

Style: keep one set per site (the default, Lucide, is a clean 24 px outline set that suits the rest of the design). Mixing sets looks accidental.

## Command line, and changing them later

```bash
node scripts/scaffold.mjs --config site.json --out ./my-site --icons auto
node scripts/scaffold.mjs --config site.json --out ./my-site --icon nav.dashboard=layout-dashboard,stats.0=package --icon-set lucide
node scripts/scaffold.mjs --apply-icons ./my-site --icon stats.1=chart-line          # change one, in a second
node scripts/scaffold.mjs --apply-icons ./my-site --icon story.0=none                # remove one
node scripts/scaffold.mjs --apply-icons ./my-site --icons none                       # remove them all
node scripts/scaffold.mjs --apply-icons ./my-site --icons auto                       # fill any empty places
```

`--apply-icons` rewrites only `src/components/icons/icons.ts` and `NOTICE.md`, the icon entries in `src/content/site.json` and `nav.json`. Pages and styles, and everything you edited, are untouched. A project generated before icons existed needs one regeneration first (the command says so).

## Where an icon comes from

In order: (1) the pack shipped with the kit, 200+ common Lucide icons (`templates/icons/lucide.json`, ISC), so a site gets icons with no network; (2) a locally installed `@iconify-json/<set>` (`npm i -D @iconify-json/tabler`); (3) the cache from an earlier run (`~/.cache/sitewright/icons`); (4) the Iconify API, unless `--offline-icons`. A name that is nowhere is an error that tells you how to find the right one, and nothing is generated.

## Licences

Every set has its own licence, read from Iconify (or the set's own info) and written into the project's `src/components/icons/NOTICE.md` with the author, the icons used and, for the kit's pack, the full licence text.

- MIT, ISC, Apache-2.0, CC0, BSD, OFL and similar: used freely; the notice file is all that is needed.
- **CC BY** (for example Font Awesome Free): allowed, with a warning and a ready-made credit line in `NOTICE.md`: credit has to be visible to people, so add it to the footer or a credits page.
- Anything else (non-commercial, GPL, unknown, or a licence that could not be read): refused. Allow a set knowingly with `--allow-icon-license <prefix>`.
- Brand logos (`simple-icons`, `logos`) are CC0 or MIT as drawings but the marks are trademarks: use them only to point to the real company, and never to suggest endorsement.

## Safety

Icon data comes from the network and ends up inlined in your pages, so every icon is rebuilt from an allow-list of drawing elements (`path`, `circle`, `rect`, `line`, `polyline`, `polygon`, `ellipse`, `g`, gradients, clip paths and masks) and attributes before it is written. Scripts, event handlers, links, `style`, `<use>`, `<image>`, text and anything else make the icon fail, and gradient and clip ids are made unique so two icons on one page never collide. The same applies to `icons.custom`. The verifier checks the rendered icons for the same.

## Adding to the kit

New places: add the slot in `iconSlots()` (`scripts/lib/icons.mjs`), render `<Icon name={...} />` in the template, add its style next to `.stat-ic` in `globals.css`, and give `verify.mjs` a check. New keywords for `auto`: the `KEYWORDS` table in the same file (whole-word stems; specific rules first). A bigger offline pack: edit the list in `tools/make-icon-pack.mjs` and run it against `npm pack @iconify-json/lucide`.
